A few benefits of using a platform to build apps are future extensibility, easier integration with other apps and higher security.\n\nPROJECTS:\nI typically do small and medium sized projects that take from a few days to a few weeks. For larger projects, 'Work Flow' diagrams are mandatory before starting: to clarify processes, minimize obstacles and speed delivery.\n\nWEBSITES:\nPlatforms delivered are minimalist in design with a primary focus on functionality for internal team use. as well as for your surrounding ecosystem. This means groups with special permissions can be created for external contractors, clients, suppliers, vendors, etc. to access their data (e.g. invoices, orders, training, calendar events, etc.). If you need a unique design I will outsource it, or you can hire your own Front-End developer.\n\nEXPERTISE:\nOver the past 10 years some projects I have completed or helped develop as a team member include: agriculture (farm management), real estate (property management service), delivery business (corporate documents), law (legal case management, incident management and complaint management), corporate training (wiki), sales (client database), Time Management (tracking of time, meetings & expenses), and others. See my 'PORTFOLIO' for a few examples (not all can be shown due to client confidentiality).\n\nLICENSE FEES:\nThe platform I use is genuine open source, there are no annual license fees, per user fees, etc. You only pay for your hosting, as you would with any app or SaaS application.\n\nDEMO:\n\"Seeing is believing\" - If a demo is necessary to win you over, just contact me and we can agree on how much is necessary.", "guru_skills": "App Development, Database, Diagrams, Data Management, Database Development, Web Portal, Workflow, CMS (Content Management System), Collaboration, Data Collecting, Data Collection, Database Driven Web Applications, Digital Content, Information Technology, Process Architect,", "guru_services": "Database Driven Web Application Platform, Platform Training,", "guru_avg_price_per_hour": "42.5" },

According to the lore the peacock dances and cries and the peahens consume the tears and fall pregnant. Thus the peacock has the ability to reproduce while remaining celibate. Lord Krishna, according to the lore had rescued, as requested by Indra, 16,100 women from Narakasura, who was holding these women prisoners. The rescued women requested Lord Krishna to save their honour and marry them. Lord Krishna granted their wish. He is also said to have married 8 more times who were his primary wives. With each of his 16,108 wives, he had 10 children. However none of these 1,61,080 children were not conceived by mating as with normal human beings. They were created by Lord Krishna with his divine powers. Thus he remained \"AJANMA BRAHMACHARI\" ('Ajanma' means forever and 'Brahmachari' is a person in Hindu culture who has taken a vow of celibacy for the rest of his life). Lord Krishna chose the majestic animals feathers as a crown to adorn his head. The peacock feather is symbolic and is usually associated with this divine character.\n\nThe name \"PAVO\" is inspired from the devotional song \"Mor Mukut\" which praises Lord Krishna. The song's literal translation means \"Peacock Crown\". \"Pavo Cristatus\" actually means Peacock.
